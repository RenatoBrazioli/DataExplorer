# DataExplorer

Not a really original name, isn't it?

Anyway, I've been thinking quite a lot of learning more about R, and to put it in use to "study" data produced by Agile Projects, both Scrum and Kanban, typically by using Jira, therefore taking control of data, instead of relying nly on Jira reports. That are a very good starting point, but I0ve found them too much influenced by the tool philosophy.

The idea is to have a general framework for Agile Data Analysis, independet of the source.

I've tried to look around a bit, and found the promising **rkanban** https://github.com/eraserhd/rkanban by Jason Felice, that, at the time of witing, is limited to CFD.

Than I've stumbled upon an article by Martin Fowler "Don't Compare Averages" https://martinfowler.com/articles/dont-compare-averages.html that, in order to support the  statement, goes quite a long way in providing examples of R to plot basic diagrams.

Therefore, I've decided to use it as a starting point, and evolve it (we'll see ...) to fit my needs.
